                                Karelian region of Finland and Russia. They are medium-sized spitz-type dogs known for
                                their courage, loyalty, and exceptional hunting abilities. Originally bred to hunt large
                                game including bears, moose, wolves, and lynx, they are fearless, intelligent, and make
                                excellent working dogs and family companions when properly trained.</p>

                                puppyhood. They are generally patient and protective of family members. However, due to
                                their high energy levels and strong prey drive, they may play too roughly with small
                                children. We recommend them for families with older children who understand how to
                                interact respectfully with dogs. Early socialization and training are essential for
                                creating a safe environment for both children and the dog.</p>

                                purebred dogs. However, they can be susceptible to certain conditions including hip

                                breeding practices, including health testing of parent dogs, helps minimize these risks.

                            <p>Karelian Bear Dogs are high-energy dogs that require 1-2 hours of vigorous exercise
                                daily. This should include long walks, running, hiking, or engaging activities like
                                agility training. They excel when they have a job to do and need both physical and
                                mental stimulation. Without adequate exercise, they can become destructive or develop
                                behavioral problems. They are not suitable for sedentary families or apartment living.

                                activity level. As an active, working breed, they may benefit from performance or active

                                rather than free-feeding to maintain a healthy weight. Always provide fresh water.
                                Consult with your veterinarian about specific nutritional needs, especially for growing

                            <p>Karelian Bear Dogs are intelligent and capable of learning quickly, but they can be
                                challenging to train due to their independent nature. They are not recommended for
                                first-time dog owners. Training requires consistency, patience, and positive
                                reinforcement methods. They respond best to confident handlers who can provide strong
                                leadership without harsh punishment. Early socialization and puppy training classes are
                                essential for developing good behavior.</p>

                                particularly those of the same sex. While some individuals can learn to coexist with
                                other pets if raised together from puppyhood, they generally do best as the only pet in
                                the household. Early socialization is crucial, but their natural instincts may still
                                create challenges in multi-pet homes.</p>

                            <p>Karelian Bear Dogs are naturally vocal and were bred to bark when they locate game. They
                                tend to bark at anything they're unsure of, including unfamiliar people and animals.
                                This makes them excellent watchdogs but can be problematic in urban or suburban
                                settings. Training can help manage excessive barking, but it's important to understand
                                that barking is a natural behavior for this breed. They're best suited for rural or
                                country settings where their vocal nature is less likely to cause issues.</p>

                                (4-6 hours) if properly exercised and mentally stimulated, they thrive in homes where
                                someone is present most of the day. They're not suited for families with long work hours

                            <p>Yes, we welcome visits from serious, pre-approved prospective buyers. Due to biosecurity
                                concerns and to minimize stress on our dogs, we don't allow casual visits. Approved
                                visitors can meet our adult dogs, see our facilities, and interact with available
                                puppies. We also conduct virtual meetings and provide extensive photos and videos for
                                those who cannot visit in person. All visits are by appointment only and follow strict
                                protocols to protect the health of our dogs.</p>

                            <p>We prefer that families pick up their puppies in person to ensure a good match and
                                provide proper transition guidance. However, we understand that distance can be a
                                challenge and will work with approved families to arrange transportation. We can
                                recommend professional pet transport services or arrange for puppies to be flown with a
                                companion. All shipping costs are the responsibility of the buyer, and we ensure all
                                travel arrangements prioritize the puppy's safety and comfort.</p>

                                inappropriate situations. We also provide support and resources to help families work
